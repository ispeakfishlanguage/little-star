Little Star Performance Club - Portfolio project #1

Little Stars is a site that hopes to promote the "Little Stars" performance club organized by the municipality of Stockholm. The site will be targeted toward the parents of children aged 3 to 5 year of age and living in Stockholm. Little Stars will be useful for parents to see exactly what times and days their kids would be able to participate in the club activities.

## Demo

### A live demo to the website can be found [here](https://ispeakfishlanguage.github.io/little-star/)

## UX
The main user group targeted by this website is parents of kids aged 3 to 5, as a secondary target we have the grandparents as well. The site is focused on simplicity and ease of navigation as well as showing examples of past activities, both while in class and during recitals, to give the adults a good idea of what to expect.

## User stories
As the sole developer of this website, my goal is to showcase my current skills in the web development area, as well as possibly secure employment opportunities in the coding industry.
These are the considerations I took while developing the webpage:

- Users want to understand what the webpage is about easily and as soon as they open the page.
- Users want to navigate around the website easily, be it by mouse, keyboard or touch screen.
- Users want to view information about the classes, what times they are and where the club is located.
- Users want to see what the club is all about and see if it would be something fun and positive for their own child/children.
- Users want to know what applies to their specific situation easily.


### Strategy
This website's goal is to showcase the classes and what benefits it could bring to the user and in this case, the user's child/children. The focus of the design was on showcasing all the fun the kids get, as well as be easy to navigate on any platform the user might have.


### Scope
For the users (parents and grandparents), the focus was on giving them a good overview of what the club's ethos is about, focusing on the benefits they could get as well as reminding them the classes are free. This way, the users can get a better idea of what activities to expect, how the club can help them and the children, as well as what applies to their specific situation through the contact form. The design was kept simple and linear, with only one page for ease of navigation and use.

### Structure
I followed the traditional CV framework since it is not overly complicated and it will be easy for the users to find the information they are looking for. The Online CV website has a single, long, scrolling page design. My structure features a fixed top navigation that connects the user to each of the sections from anywhere on the page. I have also included a link at the end of the navigation to download a copy of the traditional CV if the user likes that format.

**Website Sections:**
1. **_Home / Landing page:_** A concise introduction to the club.
2. **_About Us:_** Information about the ethos of the club, and the benefits of joining.
3. **_Gallery:_** Pictures of past activities with the kids, as well as an insight into the classroom setting.
4. **_Classes:_** The three classes for different age groups are divided into rows, followed by a bit of information about the classes.
5. **_Join now:_** A contact page featuring a basic contact form requesting user information, to get in contact with the club via the webpage.
6. **_Footer:_** This is not the main section of the website but rather an ending to the website with social media links and address with the contact information for the club.

### Skeleton
The website is designed to be clear and simple. And the site has a simple tree structure with hierarchical flows from top to bottom.

**Wireframe**
Balsamiq was used to craft the wireframe. While the actual site operates as a continuous scrolling page, in the wireframe, each section was conceptualized as its own distinct page, seamlessly integrated via navigation.

### Surface
A photography was used for the hero image on the landing page. This image is very descriptive as to what the website is about, as it features toddlers dancing in a classroom environment. A plain background color was used as to not distract from the content of the webpage itself. A color palette was generated that goes well with the theme of the website: children singing and dancing. The colors are very soft and delicate.

## Testing 

* Website was tested and working in different web browsers: Chrome, Firefox, and Microsoft Edge.
* On mobile devices, I tested the my site on an iPad and an iPhone 13 with the Safari browser.
* The website is confirmed to be responsive and functions on different screen sizes using the devtools device toolbar.
* The navigation and the sections Home, About Us, Gallery, Classes, and Join now are readable and easy to understand with the help of Lighthouse.
* The form works: it requires entries in every field, only accepts an email in the email field, and the submit button works.
* The gallery section is responsive and takes up more or less space on the screen depending on the resolution.
* The text adapts in width to accommodate smaller o larger screens, always taking up the width available.
* There are no broken links on the page

### Accessibility
Icons with ARIA labels: To ensure that screen readers can understand the content.
Images with 'alt'-text: To help users with visual impairments understand what the images are about.
Contrast Requirements: The use of easy colors and easy to read and see elements.
Dyslexia/Accessible Friendly Fonts: The font used is easy to read.

### Validator Testing 

- HTML
  - No errors were returned when passing through the official [W3C validator](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?showsource=yes&doc=https%3A%2F%2Fispeakfishlanguage.github.io%2Flittle-star%2F)
- CSS
  - No errors were found when passing through the official [(Jigsaw) validator](http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator?lang=en&profile=css3svg&uri=https%3A%2F%2Fispeakfishlanguage.github.io%2Flittle-star%2F&usermedium=all&vextwarning=&warning=1)

### Unfixed Bugs

When using the webpage on a mobile with Chrome, the menu dropdown stays open even after clicking on any of the links. This could be easily solved with JavaScript in the future. The HTML + CSS coding technologies are not enough to solve this issue at the moment.

## Deployment

- The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows: 
  - In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab 
  - From the source section drop-down menu, select the Master Branch
  - Once the master branch has been selected, the page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment.
